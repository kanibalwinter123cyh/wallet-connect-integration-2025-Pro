## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how WalletConnect integration functions in the context of automated trading and portfolio management with major exchanges.

### Executive Summary

WalletConnect itself **does not directly integrate with exchange order books for automated trading**. Its primary role is as a secure communication protocol between a decentralized wallet (like MetaMask, Trust Wallet) and a decentralized application (dApp). However, it plays a critical *indirect* role in a modern, hybrid trading stack that connects the decentralized world (DeFi) with the centralized world (CeFi - exchanges like Binance, Coinbase).

The integration for automated trading happens through the exchanges' **Official APIs**, while WalletConnect is used to securely *authorize and manage* the connection to those APIs and to interact with on-chain DeFi protocols directly.
